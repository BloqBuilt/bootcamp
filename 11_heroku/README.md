# Heroku

Today we will learn how to use Heroku to deploy our applications to the internet.

## What is Heroku?

Heroku is a "Platform as a Service" (PaaS) cloud host that offers free basic
accounts. Heroku makes it fast and easy to host your backend apps in the cloud
so that anyone, anywhere can access your apps--from e.g. a web browser or a
mobile app. This process is called "deployment." Heroku also integrates with
git, so the learning curve is not too steep.
